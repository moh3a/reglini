      "question": "What is the purpose of this app?",
      "answer": "AliExpress is one of the biggest online retail services based in China that offer products to international online buyers. While algerians are starting to use it, it is yet to be mainstream. And that's for many reasons, one of which is harsh algerian customs that imposes many rules on product imports. Another reason is that AliExpress only accepts major foreign currencies as payments. That is why we offer you to purchase from AliExpress and have it shipped to your town, using the local algerian dinars."
    },
    "f2": {
      "question": "Why order from reglini-dz?",
      "answer": "There are several Algerian online services that take customer requests and take care of ordering and paying Aliexpress while receiving their payments in DZD. Basically this is also what reglini-dz does, but also allows a great user experience, who has full access to products, orders and package tracking. All this is automatic and without the need for intermediary help."
    },
    "f3": {
      "question": "How does ordering from reglini-dz work?",
      "item1": "First you find an item that you like, check if it can be shipped to Algeria and at what price.",
      "item2": "Select the properties of the item then add it to cart, or even directly buy it.",
      "item3": "Buying an item is submitting an order, that needs the real legal name and the full correct address and phone number of the buyer.",
      "item4": "If all the informations are validated, an order is created. The buyer then has 48 hours to submit a payment with the order's total amount. If no payment was submitted in 48 hours, the order will be automatically cancelled.",
      "item5": "The payment should be once and with the total amount.",
      "item6": "After the payment was submitted and validated, you can then check the status of your order, and even see the tracking of your item -if your product's carrier provides it."
    },
    "f4": {
      "question": "How to make a payment via CCP?",
      "answer": "<div>At the counter of any post office, and on a unique SFP01 form available at the counter or <a href=\"https://www.poste.dz/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">downloadable from the Internet</a>. The payment requires a description of the beneficiary's CCP account number and key on the SFP01 and a cash remittance of the payment amount at the counter.</div><br /><div><p>Name: AIT ABDELMALEK MOHAMED ALI</p><p>CCP number and key: 0020008646 key 02</p></div>"
    },
    "f5": {
      "question": "How does a transaction via CIB work?",
      "answer": "<p>If you have a CIB, you can make payments online safely and reliably. And for each payment transaction made using the card, a payment receipt is issued to the customer. The payment receipt contains information relating to the payment transaction carried out as well as other information generated by the system and giving indications on the progress of the transaction. This receipt must be taken in screenshot by the customer and be sent as much payment at the level of the reglini-dz order.</p><p>All you need to complete the transaction is the RIB of the account you are going to pay.</p><br /><p>RIB: 007 99999 0020008646 02</p>"
    },
    "f6": {
      "question": "Products authorized for import",
      "answer": "<p>You should know that the laws differ from one country to another, what can be authorized in one country is not necessarily authorized in the other, and your purchase could then be blocked at the level of the Algerian customs. Therefore, avoid any product that may constitute a danger to others or endanger national security.</p><p>For a complete list of goods prohibited or suspended from importation, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.douane.gov.dz/spip.php?article104&lang=fr\" rel=\"noreferrer\">visit the official site of the Algerian customs.</a></p>"
